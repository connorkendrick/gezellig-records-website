Loud, bitter noise rock birthed in Austin, TX, currently located in Chicago. Queer, femme-fronted, the androgynous opposite of "yes men", anti-everything. Equal parts 69, 420, and 666. Bass VI, dueling vocals, dual drums. No "guitar rock" allowed.


"Needed" cassette available through Young Cubs.  
Full length LP "Dear God Bring The Doom" available through Gezellig Records.
