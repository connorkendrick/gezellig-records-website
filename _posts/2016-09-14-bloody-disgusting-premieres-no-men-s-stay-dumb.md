The internet’s most trafficked horror genre website BLOODY-DISGUSTING premieres NO MEN’s first music video for their first single “Stay Dumb.”  

Watch the video [here](http://bloody-disgusting.com/music/3404993/no-men-embrace-giallo-murder-stay-dumb-video-exclusive/ ) or below.

Greg Stephen Reigh, the video’s director, shares with BLOODY-DISGUSTING, “The video is a tongue-in-cheek homage to the Italian Giallo thrillers of the 70’s and a love letter to horror icons Dario Argento and Mario Bava, in all their colorful, trashy glory. Shot on a shoestring budget, the video was made possible by the generosity of Chicago’s DIY music scene, who donated their locations to the production.”

The music video for “Stay Dumb” precedes NO MEN’s debut album Dear God, Bring The Doom out via cassette on October 8, 2016, on GEZELLIG RECORDS. Pre-orders are available [here](http://gezelligrecords.com/releases/dear-god-bring-the-doom) or NO MEN’s [bandcamp](http://no-men.bandcamp.com).
