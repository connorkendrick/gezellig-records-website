Peak Physique is comprised of veteran musicians Matt Honkonen (Tenderhooks/Llama Train) and Wil Wright (LiL iFFy/Senryu). The group's sound has been built on a blending of slow, heavy-handed samples/beats, sparse/delicate vocals and guitar, and by channeling a bit of 1970's soul, schizophrenic modern pop, and sinful living. The result is an unexpectedly raw, exotic sound.
