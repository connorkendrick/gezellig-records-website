Hot off the tails of their first tour, [PEAK PHYSIQUE](http://www.ilovepeakphysique.com) brings together a collection of five tracks to form I Belong To You. Their second release for GEZELLIG RECORDS and their first EP, I Belong To You starts with the shimmering, dreamlike “Hell.” The duo then guides you through “About That Life”, “Electrosex” and “When The Spell Breaks.”  Closing track “Up : Out” ties together the whole EP. These five songs combine floating percussion and ethereal production with electro-funk, robotic intimacy.

PEAK PHYSIQUE is here to help you with love and sex. Their goal is to bring people together… mostly at the face, hands, and bathing suit areas.  

I Belong To You is a taste of what PEAK PHYSIQUE has to come. This limited edition EP will offer a sample of their sound before their debut album arrives on November 1, 2016.
