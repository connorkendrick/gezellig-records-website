It can be understood to mean a feeling of belonging and togetherness. It can also mean a nice, cosy, and fun atmosphere. The positive experience shared with others is the thread that ties the translations together.</p><br><p>Gezellig Records was founded by Ben T O Smith. He is one of the hosts of The Indie Aisle – the experimental and independent music radio show on WUTK 90.3FM in Knoxville, Tennessee.</p><br><p>Please direct all media inquiries to gezelligrecords@gmail.com or 865.755.3833</p><br><p>For more information:</p><p><a href='http://gezelligrecords.com'>http://gezelligrecords.com</a></p><p><a href='https://gezelligrecords.bandcamp.com/'>https://gezelligrecords.bandcamp.com/</a></p><p><a href='http://twitter.com/gezelligrecords'>http://twitter.com/gezelligrecords</a></p>"
