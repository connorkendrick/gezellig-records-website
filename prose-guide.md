This is a fool-proof guide on how to use the prose.io interface
----------------------------------------------------------------




USING MARKDOWN
---------------
Hit dat question mark button in the editor when you create a file. Read carefully, and it'll answer every question you have. If that isn't enough, visit the website they link to.




UPLOADING IMAGES
-----------------
You'll need to upload an image for every new artist, release, and article you post. They way prose handles image uploading isn't the best, so here's how to do it:
1.  Go to the images folder
2.  Select the folder that matches what you're uploading an image for
3.  Note the naming conventions of the image files in the folder, and name the image on your computer to be uploaded accordingly
4.  Hit 'New File'
5.  Hit the 'Insert Image' button in the editor, press the link 'select one', select your image from your computer, and press 'Insert'
6.  The image is now uploaded to the folder you're in. Press the back button to go back to the folder, and the unneeded Markdown file you were on will disappear.




BIOS
-----
When you create a new file for an artist, hit the title at the top, and rename it following the naming conventions of the other bio files (artist-name.md).
So the bar at the top should read 'bios/artist-name.md' with artist-name being whatever the name of the artist is.

Then, write up a bio for the artist. After you've done that, hit the 'meta-data' tab on the right side, and fill out the info, pressing 'DONE' when finished.
Note: Website, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, etc. are not required to be filled out. Artist and Bio Photo are required, however.
Note pt. 2: Make sure the file name for the Bio Photo is exactly the same name as the file you uploaded in /images/artists (sometimes .jpg files make the .jpg extension all caps, so watch out)

Finally, hit 'Save' on the right side, and press 'Commit' on the box that pops up.




POSTS
------
ALBUMS:
*   Create a new file, keep the date part in the title up at the top, then change the 'your-filename' part to a name like the other files (band-name-album-name.md)
*   Just look at the other files if you can't remember what to name the file.

*   Don't write anything in the content section. Just fill out the meta-data.
*   The download link doesn't necessarily have to be a download. I felt like I needed to say that for some reason. It's just the link you want people to be taken to when they click the release.
*   REMEMBER: make sure the image name is exactly the same as the image file name


ARTICLES:
*   When you create a new file, make the title at the top just like how you want it to show up in the article. It'll be renamed to fit the correct format.
*   Ex. What you entered: Gezellig Records Releases New Merch  -->  File name created automatically: 2016-07-30-gezellig-records-releases-new-merch.md
*   Write whatever you want, then go to the meta-data and add an article image




ABOUT
------
For some reason, new line breaks for the staff section don't work correctly right now, so just use an unordered list.
The bullet points are turned off for this page and it'll look just like a line break.




COZY CLUB
----------
Everything on this page is pretty self-explanatory. Just pay attention to the double-space new line breaks.




SHOWS
------
The double-space new line break is the exact same as a new paragraph on this page. Use whatever method floats your boat.




SUMMARY
--------
You probably didn't need this long of a guide, because a lot of it can be inferred from looking around at and in other files.
There were some specifics that I did want to point out, though.
Hopefully this helped!
