<!-- Put 2 spaces after a line to create a new line -->
<!-- Example -->
<!--
This line has two spaces at the end, making the line under it show as a new line in browser  
If the line above didn't have these spaces, this line wouldn't show up as a new line in browser
-->

<!-- Put two new lines in between lines to create a space between them -->
<!-- Example -->
<!--
In the browser, there will be a space in between this line and the next line


This is used to separate lines with larger gaps, rather than just new lines
